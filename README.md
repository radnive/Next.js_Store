## What is Store?

A store website for those who are looking for quality and original products. Here you can see a list of more than 5000 thousand products in different categories in a simple and beautiful way and choose the product you want easily among these products. It is also possible to search and filter products. This website is powered by Next.js and written with Typescript and Sass. It also takes help from libraries like Lottie, GSAP3, Axios, etc. Its demo version is located on Liara servers, which you can find the address [here](#see-demo-version). Also, the user interface design of this website is inspired by the designs of **Ehsan Gholampour** and **Bogdan Falin**, which you can see [here](#useful-links).
